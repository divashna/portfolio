    <!-- objective -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Objective</h3>
      <p>Given the growing number of streaming services entering a highly competitive market, it was crucial for Stan to maintain its competitive edge and keep users on the platform for longer. Senior leaders within the company were becoming concerned that Stan did not present its content in the most appealing way. They feared this would lead to a loss of engagement with our catalogue as competitors continued to showcase content in more meaningful forms.</p>
      <p>The Content Merchandising project aimed to:
        <ol>
          <li>Drive active subscribers to engage with and consume more content</li>
          <li>Make Stan look less "boring" when compared to key players in the market</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- the challenge -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">The Challenge</h3>
      <p>The initial brief of the project was to “make Stan look like Netflix,” as senior stakeholders presumed this would be the most optimal way to make the platform more immersive, thereby increasing engagement. However, my team, consisting of myself, the Product Design Lead and the lead Product Manager for this project maintained that the best way to increase engagement would be to validate our assumptions and test solutions with users as opposed to creating a direct copy of competitor streaming services.</p>
      <p>Initially, there was a great deal of hesitance to test and validate our designs with users, though in time we successfully persuaded senior leaders to invest in user research and testing and invited them to be part of the data-driven Content Merchandising journey.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- understanding the problem -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Understanding the Problem</h3>
      <p>I first paired up with the primary Product Manager of the project to understand what we were really trying to achieve. Initially, we were both at a loss as to what the outcomes of this project would be. Over multiple impromptu FigJam sessions, moments of confusion and frustration and the occasional outbursts of excitement and inspiration, we mapped out what “Content Merchandising” really meant and agreed that the end goal was to increase engagement on Stan through interface design.</p>

      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Discovery Workshop</h3>
      <p>Now that we had a clearer picture of what the project entailed, the lead Product Manager entrusted me to run a discovery workshop with stakeholders to understand the needs of their teams and how they applied to Content Merchandising.</p>
      <p>As a team, we collectively brainstormed:
        <ul>
          <li>Goals for the project</li>
          <li>Known issues with the way we presented content on the platform</li>
          <li>Measures of success</li>
          <li>The scope of the project</li>
          <li>Potential risks; and</li>
          <li>The core squad who would actively be involved in the project</li>
        </ul>

      <p class="p text-center"><i>Shared project goals brainstormed and discussed by the participating group</i></p>
      <p>This workshop proved valuable in aligning all stakeholders to a shared vision for Content Merchandising, and actively encouraged participants to contribute to the momentum and success of the project. The insights from the workshop would also reveal what research needed to be conducted before we could begin concepting solutions.</p>

    <!-- secondary research -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Secondary Research</h3>
      <p>Not long after the workshop, a spanner was thrown into the works. After meetings among senior stakeholders, it had been advised that the timeframe for the project would be shortened to prioritise future initiatives. This meant we now had six weeks to design, research, test and deliver a solution that would increase user engagement on the platform. To meet this deadline, the scope of the project was refined. We were advised to explore how newly designed feeds on the home page could encourage viewership and increase engagement with the platform's shows and movies (collectively, titles).</p>
      <p>As such, I immediately set out to conduct research into the problem space. I completed both an internal audit of how Stan presented its content on platform, and a competitor analysis to gauge what the industry's best practices were. After a thorough review of these services, which included the likes of Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Paramount+, I presented the following recommendations to the Content Merchandising squad:</p>
      <!-- recommendations list -->
      <ul><br>
        <li>A <b>variation of feed sizes and shapes</b> will allow Stan to highlight key titles on the home page</li>
        <li><b>Existing assets</b> should be leveraged when creating new feed styles. This will not only enable internal teams to streamline their workflow, but will reduce implementation complexity</li>
        <li><b>Visibility of key titles</b> should be maintained by strategically positioning feeds to drive consumption</li>
        <li>Many of our competitors promote exclusive content through <b>mid-page banners or carousels</b>. This not only has the benefit of reducing cognitive load, but may draw users' attention to featured titles on Stan</li>
        <li>Accessibility issues within graphics may be addressed by <b>positioning</b> key title metadata outside the image or using gradients to maintain contrast</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>These insights allowed stakeholders to picture what was working well at Stan and what could be improved across different streaming services. They were used to inform the ideation process for the designs.</p>

    <!-- concepting the solution -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Concepting the Solution</h3>
      <p>Drawing inspiration from my research, I concepted how I could increase user engagement through new feed designs on the Stan platform. After multiple rounds of sketches, wireframes and mockups, I presented my ideas back to the Content Merchandising squad and collected feedback from a Design Critique workshop. The feedback from the workshop proved valuable for further refining the designs. The Design Critique session also served as a project check-in and ensured all stakeholders were engaged and committed to the vision of the project.</p>

    <!-- devising a user research plan -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Devising a User Research Plan</h3>
      <p>An important aspect of the project involved validating assumptions that our designs were “boring” in the eyes of our users. As a result, I paired with the Product Design Lead to define how we might be able to achieve this while testing the designs I had put together.</p>
      <p>We decided to conduct user research in the form of a desirability study with follow-up survey questions. This research method was used to understand users' perceptions of the new feed designs compared to the existing feeds on Stan's home page. We put together a plan of how to recruit participants, which questions would be asked and which insights we were hoping to gain. Prior to sending out the survey, however, we enlisted the help of the Content Merchandising squad to offer feedback on how the survey could be improved.</p>
      <p>The responses we collected revealed there was room for improvement. As the Lead and I sat down to review the results from the surveys, we identified that responses became less detailed towards the end of the form- which was linked to feedback that there were too many open-ended questions in the survey. We subsequently made adjustments to the survey, including reducing the number of open-ended questions, asking more probing questions into what our participants' sentiments towards the designs were, and a restructure of the survey to draw greater attention to the designs.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Analysing the Data</h3>
      <p>The Product Design Lead and I sent out the desirability survey to 50 participants we had recruited based on their use of streaming services. To prevent bias, we selected both Stan and non-Stan users and ensured they did not have industry connections to media, entertainment, IT or design.</p>
      <p>The analysis revealed that the new feed designs were well-received by research participants. More users claimed the new designs were “clean”, “consistent” and “entertaining” compared to the existing interface. Fewer participants used negative phrases to describe the new designs, with adjectives such as “boring”, “repetitive” and “overwhelming” dropping in position.</p>

      <p>It was time to present the output of the project back to the business. With the assistance of the lead Product Manager, I prepared a showcase for the wider business, taking stakeholders through the new designs we had put together and how the insights from our research helped us deliver a better user experience. The showcase was met with positivity from senior leaders, who were impressed by what had been achieved in under two months and were eager to see the solution go live.</p>

    <!-- outcomes -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Outcomes</h3>
      <p>Following the showcase, I worked closely with developers to hand over the designs, bringing them to life.

      <p>Although I would have liked to spend much more time on the discovery and research stages of this project, I consider this project a success for a few reasons. I consider the biggest win of this project to be the cultural shift my team and I have inspired among senior stakeholders within the business. In the showcase, it was evident that stakeholders had a newfound appreciation for user research and testing. They are now willing to commit more to long-term research and delivery for future projects, continuing to build on the success of the Content Merchandising initiative.</p>
