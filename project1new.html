        travel.</h2>
      <p>Emerging technologies, government-funded space programs and the efforts of private enterprises in travelling to
        outer space has brought humanity closer to travelling to Mars than ever before.</p>
      <p>The potential exists for the tourism industry to send humans to the Red Planet in the near future. There is an
        opportunity to <b>design user interfaces that enhance the experience of travelling to Mars</b> in the mid-trip
        phase, when passengers are onboard the space shuttle.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- step 1: understanding the problem -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3" role="heading" aria-level="3">1. Understanding the Problem</h3>
      <p>I first conducted generative research on issues faced by astronauts who have previously journeyed to outer
        space. The findings revealed that:</p>
      <li>The negative psychological effects of extended space ventures have been overlooked by NASA (Kanas, 2015)</li>
      <li>Isolation and confinement in space trigger extreme anxiety and stress in astronauts (Kanas, 2015)</li>
      <li>Isolation and confinement can lead to a “decline in mood, cognition, morale or interpersonal interaction,”
        which can result in depression (Abadie, Lloyd & Shelhamer, 2020)</li>
      <li>Communication between Mars-bound shuttles and Earth can take over 40 minutes (Weir, 2018)</li>
      <li>Enhanced methods of communication between Earth and space shuttles can help reduce conflict and psychological
        stress in space (Weir, 2018)</li>
      <li>Connection to family and friends may help astronauts manage stress and anxiety (Kanas, 2015)</li>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>These findings enabled me to further uncover the root of the problem through the 5 Whys method and enabled me
        to define the problem:</p>
      <i>The journey to outer space has a deep and lasting mental toll on astronauts, hence the need to effectively
        manage mental health when travelling to Mars.
      </i>
      <ol class="mt-2">
        <li><i>Why? </i>Space is a new and confronting environment for many astronauts, which amplifies its mental toll.
        </li>
        <li><i>Why? </i>The demanding nature of space leads to psychological imbalances in the brain and body.
        </li>
        <li><i>Why? </i>Imbalances are fuelled by stress and pressure astronauts encounter in space.
        </li>
        <li><i>Why? </i>Stress is oftentimes an outcome of isolation from Earth and family.
        </li>
        <li><i>Why? </i>The physical and emotional distance from Earth and their loved ones are difficult to manage for
          months on end.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- step 2: analysing the competition -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3" role="heading" aria-level="3">2. Analysing The Competition</h3>
      <p>My generative research highlighted the lack of mental health attention in space, which I had chosen to further
        explore through competitor research of mental health management platforms. I analysed four app-based interfaces:
        TalkLife, Replika, Happify and HearMe.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container row align-items-start">
      <div class="col-md pb-2">
        <img alt="TalkLife" src="images/project1/Talk Life.jpg" />
      </div>
      <div class="col-md pb-2">
        <img alt="Replika" src="images/project1/Replika.jpg" />

      <div class="col-md pb-2">
        <img alt="HearMe" src="images/project1/HearMe.jpg" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>The competitor analysis highlighted the effectiveness of the platforms in engaging with its target audience due to the following components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessibility: an accessible platform largely contributed to its usability, hence accessibility must be at the forefront of the final design solution.
        </li>
        <li>Availability: Mental health services that are readily available to users can increase engagement with the mental health service. This reduces barriers to mental health services and would be beneficial for space travel as it would eliminate the need to depend on others for support.
        </li>
        <li>Social interaction: Social interactions were drivers for engagement across all applications, hence it must be prioritised in the final design. Social interactions included text-based messaging and posting on community platforms.
        </li>
        <li>Feedback: Verbal, audio and textual feedback provided by competitors enabled users to effectively track their mental wellbeing and progress. Visual feedback must, therefore, be emphasised in the final solution.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- overview -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3" role="heading" aria-level="3">The importance of public health messaging</h3>
      <p>The outbreak of COVID-19 and the spread of misinformation that has followed has highlighted the need to keep
        ethnic and minority communities in Australia engaged with public health messages regarding COVID-19 symptoms and
        testing. To address a lack of engagement with health alerts, I designed a product where individuals could locate
        relevant, accurate and real-time information about the virus and ensure all Australians are empowered to engage
        with public health messages.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- preliminary research -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Preliminary Research</h3>
      <p>In order to understand the issues multicultural communities face when accessing health information, I first
        conducted preliminary research on the barriers and pain points experienced by such communities. As part of my
        research, I conducted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secondary research in the form of background research</li>
        <li>A SWOT analysis of four existing competitor services- The <em>COVIDSafe</em> app, <em>Coronavirus
            Australia</em> app, <em>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Health Alert</em> and the <em>Australian Government WhatsApp
            Channel for COVID-19</em></li>
        <li>An online ethnography of 62 reviews from the four competitors; and</li>
        <li>A questionnaire which produced 19 unique insights from users</li>
      </ul>

          <p>The results showed that multicultural communities that had previously been disadvantaged by the health
            system struggled to access accurate and reliable information about the virus due to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A lack of engagement with community and/or cultural leaders</li>
            <li>Poor accessibility</li>
            <li>Limited availability of resources</li>
            <li>Poor multilingual support; and</li>

    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Problem Definition</h3>
      <p>The research indicated that a major weakness of existing health messages was a lack of multilingual support,
        which limited engagement with emerging health advice. This pain point was consequently selected as the basis for
        the product development. A problem statement was established to simplify the problem and highlight key user
        needs that would need to be addressed in the final design:</p>
      <p><em>Multicultural communities cannot engage with COVID-19 public health messages as they arrive due to a lack
          of resources provided for multilingual and non-English speakers. The solution should provide a platform where
          individuals can instantaneously and actively engage with health messages in order to reduce misconceptions
          regarding coronavirus symptoms and testing procedures.</em></p>

          <p>To develop a platform that allows multicultural communities to engage with public health messages about
            COVID-19 symptoms and testing, I created sketches to determine which features and components could be
            integrated in a web application to accomplish this. Multiple iterations of a web-based application were
            created to identify a concept that would best meet the needs of users.</p>

    <!-- prototype -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Prototype</h3>
      <p>A high-fidelity prototype of the final concept, COVID Connect, was then established. The website was designed
        to automatically offer multilingual support through one's browser, whereas information would also be made
        accessible through the use of icons and images.</p>
      <p>Users are also offered the ability to contact community leaders in their language of choice so they can
        actively engage with health messages regarding COVID-19 symptoms and testing. The final website offers an
        accessible, reliable and engaging means of locating COVID-19 health messages in comparison to existing products.
        As such, the solution addresses barriers to accessing health messages while reducing misconceptions about
        COVID-19 symptoms and testing procedures.</p>
