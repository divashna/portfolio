      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">The challenge of food waste</h3>
        <p>Food waste is a major agricultural and climate change issue that affects all facets of Australian society. To address this issue, the Green Bean team designed a food waste app that empowers Australian businesses and households to track their food usage and household waste. This intends to prevent excess food from being purchased, thus limiting food from reaching landfill and reducing food waste across the country.</p>

      <!-- preliminary research -->
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Preliminary Research</h3>
        <p>To better understand the needs and attitudes of Australian households and businesses towards reducing food waste, I conducted preliminary research on food conservation and waste in Australia. This research allowed me to better understand why food waste occurs and provided a gateway for designing a feasible solution. The research revealed that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>20% of food purchases by Australians are wasted</li>
          <li>1.3m tonnes of food waste are generated in Australia each year</li>
          <li>Each Australian throws out 300kg of food a year; and</li>
          <li>76% of Australians care about food waste</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- problem definiton -->
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Problem Definition</h3>
        <p>The next step of the process was to formulate a problem statement which would guide the process of designing and developing the app:</p>
        <p><em>Australian households and business owners often buy more food than can reasonably be consumed, leading to large amounts of food waste as they pass their use-by dates. The solution should provide a platform where Australian businesses and residents can track their food usage in order to avoid buying an excess amount of produce and, therefore, reduce food waste.

            <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Sketches</h3>
            <p>I then created several sketches to gain a better understanding of how the final platform would look.</p>
            <p>Three iterations of sketches were created to visualise the style and layout of the features in the app. The sketches were also used to identify which iteration best showcased the different functions in the app.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Wireframes</h3>
        <p>After selecting one iteration of the sketches, I created wireframes of the app to determine the layout of its features and functions. I composed several versions of the wireframes, each of which tested different layouts and shapes to determine the best visual layout.</p>

        <p>An interactive prototype was developed on Figma using the startup's brand guidelines. The Green Bean app has been optimised for mobile users and is a convenient, easy-to-use app for both households and businesses.</p>
        <p>The app features options for users to track their food waste, create meals based on the ingredients in their pantry and only purchase ingredients as needed, thus avoiding food waste. Food conservation results are further displayed to the user, providing incentives to continually reduce food waste.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Although a successful start to the Green Bean project, further enhancements may be made for future developments of the app. This includes adding external integrations to more effectively measure food conservation efforts. However, the prototype may now be tested with external users to determine if it is effective as both a sort-term and long-term mechanism for reducing food waste in Australia.</p>
        <p>As my first fully-fledged UI project, this project has challenged me to create solutions that are both feasible and viable. The Green Bean project has also offered me insight into the startup world and revealed the importance of being adaptable when designing products to ensure proposed solutions match the current landscape.</p>
