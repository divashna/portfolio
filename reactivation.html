    <!-- objective -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Objective</h3>
      <p>The business problem that was assigned was simple: Simplify the reactivation process for returning users to
        reduce drop-off rates during reactivation, thereby increasing retention. From a user perspective, the aim was to
        reduce the complexity and frustration associated with re-enabling a Stan subscription.</p>

    <!-- problems -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Problems</h3>
      <p>To better understand the issues surrounding reactivation, I conducted an audit of the existing user flow. Three
        key issues emerged:</p>
      <h5 class="h5 mt-4" role="heading" aria-level="5">1. Cluttered UI</h5>
      <li>Incorrect use of white space ➝ cluttered interface</li>
      <li>Unclear visual hierarchy ➝ key information not focal</li>
      <li>Design inconsistencies ➝ prevents a logical flow of information</li>
      <!-- issue 2 -->
      <h5 class="h5 mt-4" role="heading" aria-level="5">2. Use of CTAs</h5>
      <li>Varied positioning of CTAs ➝ users make unintended calls</li>
      <li>Long, wordy CTAs ➝ adds to UI clutter</li>
      <li>Disabled appearance of secondary CTA ➝ users discouraged from undoing actions; instead abandon the
        reactivation process</li>
      <li><em>Start Watching</em> CTA ➝ misleading</li>
      <!-- issue 3 -->
      <h5 class="h5 mt-4" role="heading" aria-level="5">3. Mobile experience</h5>
      <li>Long and cluttered UI on mobile ➝ cognitive overload</li>
      <li>Requires extensive scrolling by the user</li>

    <!-- opportunities -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Opportunities</h3>
      <p>These insights revealed numerous opportunities for improvement which were discussed with key stakeholders
        before being concepted and implemented. The changes that would be addressed in the redesigns included:</p>

    <!-- proposing a new flow -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Proposing a New Flow</h3>
      <p>The next step was to visualise a new and improved reactivation user flow. I started by mapping the existing
        flow to understand the key steps involved in the reactivation process.</p>
      <a href="images/reactivation/reactivation_old_flow.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="mt-4 long-img"
          src="images/reactivation/reactivation_old_flow.png"
          alt="User logs in. From login, there are two paths a user can take: update payment or reactivate account. If a user updates their payment method, they are then directed to reactivation. For users who log in without a Stan Sport add-on, they are taken to a Stan Sport upsell modal, whereas users who previously purchased the subscription can skip this step. From there, users are shown limited time offers before they can start watching."></a>
      <p>Immediately, I was able visualise how the reactivation flow could be simplified to ensure users who previously
        purchased a Stan Sport add-on and those without would encounter a single, consistent reactivation experience. I
        was also able to identify steps that could be combined to deliver a smooth and efficient user experience for
        customers. With this in mind, I crafted the new user flow.</p>
      <a href="images/reactivation/reactivation_new_flow.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="mt-4 long-img"
          src="images/reactivation/reactivation_new_flow.png"
          alt="User logs in. User is then directed to reactivate their account. Once complete, they are directed to a welcome and bonus offers before they start watching."></a>
      <p>The new user flow I proposed simplified the reactivation process for all returning Stan customers. A clean,
        consistent and quicker reactivation flow would allow users to achieve their objective- to reactivate their plan-
        with minimal distraction and, therefore, encourage them to complete the process. Payment updates had also been
        integrated in the reactivation step for simplicity and ease of use.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- designs -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Designs</h3>
      <p>New designs for the reactivation flow followed. After multiple rounds of feedback from internal product
        managers and my trusty design team, I finalised the designs. Once approved, I defined the specifications of each
        design, which involved setting up new components in the UI library, and paired with a frontend engineer to bring
        them to life.</p>
      <a href="images/reactivation/reactivation_designs.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="mt-4 long-img"

    </div>
    <!-- testing the variants -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Testing the Variants</h3>
      <p>It was time to put the new designs to test using multivariate testing software. Multivariate testing revealed that the new
        designs were favoured over the existing interface. This, in turn, had a positive effect on retention, as users
        were evidently more likely to follow through with a reactivation process that reduced the number of clicks
        involved with reactivating an account while removing interface clutter.</p>

      <p>The new solution that had been designed and tested resulted in an uptick in

        streamlined reactivation experience for customers. The new designs have been rolled out on web, ranging from a
        compact mobile view to an extra-large desktop display.</p>
